1. **Understand Point Estimates and Sampling Variability:** Define a sample statistic (point estimate) for a population parameter, and explain how it varies across different samples. [Q3] **Core**
2. **Visualize and Interpret Sampling Distributions:** Draw and interpret sampling distributions for a point estimate (e.g., population proportion) across different sample sizes, explaining how the distribution changes as the sample size increases. [Q3] **Core**
3. **Inference for a Single Proportion:** Design, execute, and interpret confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for a single proportion. [Q3] **Core**

3. **Explain and Use the t-Distribution:** Explain how the t-distribution differs from the normal distribution and why it is used for population mean inference. [Q4] Auxiliary
4. **Conduct and Interpret t-Tests:** Design, execute, and interpret t-tests for a single population mean, a difference of paired means, and a difference of independent means, calculating the standard error appropriately for each. Describe how to obtain a p-value for a t-test and a critical t-score for a confidence interval. [Q4] **Core**

6. **Calculate Test Power and Evaluate Factors:** Calculate the power of a test for a given effect size and significance level, and explain how the power would change with variations in effect size, sample size, significance level, or standard error. [Q5] Auxiliary
7. **Conduct and Interpret ANOVA:** Assess whether conditions for an ANOVA are met, and if so, design, execute, and interpret the test to compare sample means across several groups. [Q5] Auxiliary

## Module 5: Beyond Recipes: Frequentist and Bayesian Approaches to Statistical Modeling
*(*Bayes' Rules*, Chapters 1–3; 5 objectives: 5 auxiliary)*

1. **The Frequentist Perspective:** Explain how Frequentist modeling uses sampling distributions to evaluate estimators. Describe the difference between a sampling distribution and a likelihood. Use maximum likelihood to estimate a parameter and identify which of the estimators in the course are maximum likelihood estimators. [Q5] Auxiliary
2. **The Bayesian Perspective:** Explain how Bayesian modeling uses likelihoods, priors, and posteriors to perform inference. Explain how Bayesian analyses can be updated sequentially as new data arrives and how the results remain invariant to the order in which the data is observed. [Q5] Auxiliary

   2. in a written report. [P2] **Core**
