# MA 213 Lab Summary

This version preserves the original course sequence so that the lab flow stays familiar to students while still being aligned with the lecture schedule and learning objectives.

## Sequence that follows the original course order

- Each week includes 3 lectures and 1 lab.
- The lab/project flow below follows the original sequence: Lab 1, Lab 2, Lab 3, P1-1, Lab 4, Lab 5, P1-2, P2-1, Lab 6, P2-2/P2-3, Lab 7.
- The lecture anchors are used to show where each item best fits in the course timeline.

| Sequence item | Lecture anchor | Main purpose | Main objective focus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lab 1 | Lecture 1 | R Intro and first data exploration | Module 1 and Module 6 |
| Lab 2 | Lecture 3 | Data transformation and interpretation  | Module 1 |
| Lab 3 | Lecture 6 | Data visualization, and interpretation | Module 2 |
| P1-1 | Lecture 8 | Project 1 launch and planning | Modules 1 and 6 |
| Lab 4 | Lecture 11 | Probability rules and Expectation/Variance Rules | Module 2 |
| Lab 5 | Lecture 14 | Simulating LLN/CLT with Different Distributions | Module 3 |
| P1-2 | After Lab 5 | Project 1 workday and feedback | Modules 1 and 6 |
| P2-1 | Before Lab 6 | Project 2 launch and planning | Modules 3–6 |
| Lab 6 | Lecture 22 | Confidence intervals and hypothesis tests | Modules 3 and 4 |
| P2-2 | After Lab 6  | Project 2 workdays and report revisions | Modules 5 and 6 |
| P2-3 | After P2-2 | Project 2 workdays and report revisions | Modules 5 and 6 |
| Lab 7 | Lecture 30 | Regression or Bayesian extension | Module 4 and optional Module 5 |

## How this sequence connects to lectures and objectives

- The original order is preserved so students see the planned progression clearly.
- Labs 1–3 build foundational R and data/probability skills before Project 1 begins.
- Lab 4 and Lab 5 connect probability and sampling ideas to the later inference units.
- Project workdays are placed exactly where they support the course flow rather than replacing the lab sequence.

## Skills labs and projects

### Skills lab
- Labs 1–7 are designed to build the computational and statistical workflow used throughout the course.
- Every lab should include a short pre-lab preparation, a guided in-lab activity, and a post-lab submission.

### Projects
- Project 1: presentation-based exploratory analysis
- Project 2: written report using inference and modeling tools

## Tutorial plan

Tutorials should be used as preparation for the corresponding lab so students arrive ready to use the tools. A fuller development plan is available in [tutorial_development_plan.md](/Users/ylim2/Documents/01_Work/06_Summer2026/MA213/Tutorial_MA213/tutorial_development_plan.md).

## Project support sessions in the original order

### P1-1: Project 1 launch
- Use this session after Lab 3 to introduce the project prompt, rubric, data access, and timeline.
- Students should leave with a clear project question and a first analysis plan.

### P1-2: Project 1 workday
- Use this session after Lab 5 to help students refine plots, summaries, and presentation structure.
- The emphasis should remain on data interpretation and clear communication.

### P2-1: Project 2 launch
- Use this session before or near Lab 6 so students can begin connecting inference methods to their report.
- Students should identify candidate response and explanatory variables and think about possible methods.

### P2-2/P2-3: Project 2 workdays
- Use these sessions around the inference unit to support analysis, revision, peer review, and report polishing.
- Students should be encouraged to justify both the method choice and the interpretation.
